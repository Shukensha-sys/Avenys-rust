# Changelog

All notable changes to Mire are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Repository hygiene improvements: standard `.gitignore` added to prevent committing build artifacts (`target/`, `bin/*`, `benchmarks/build/`).
- Removed tracked generated artifacts from git index (`target/`, `benchmarks/build/`, `bin/debug`, `bin/release`) to keep repository lean.
- Syntax documentation standardized into a single canonical file: `SYNTAX.md`.
- `README.md` rewritten for current project status and clearer onboarding.
- Incremental cache format updated to `v5` to reduce in-memory and on-disk metadata duplication.

### Fixed
- Removed unused constant in incremental cache module (`src/incremental.rs`) to keep warnings clean.
- Simplified enum top-level scan patterns in parser (`src/parser/mod.rs`) by collapsing nested match/if branches without behavior changes.
- Reduced unnecessary `Program` cloning in loader parse/cache path (`src/loader.rs`).
